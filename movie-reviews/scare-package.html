        <p>
            The movie’s wraparound story, “Rad Chad’s Horror Emporium,” takes place in the titular character’s (Jeremy
            King) VHS rental store, where he’s busy training new employee Hawn (Hawn Tran) and fending off obsessive,
            pestering horror buff Sam (Byron Brown). Between their amusingly relatable banter, full of genre references
            and goofy quips as it is, one of the three characters typically stumbles across a VHS playing one of the
            film’s stories, and that’s the basic structure.
            <br>
            But things first kick off with “Cold Open” from Emily Hagins (Coin Heist), which follows background horror
            movie character Mike (Jon Michael Simpson) as he tries his damnedest to become a more prominent presence.
            His attempts to insinuate himself into a bigger role inevitably backfire in ways both hilarious and grisly,
            shades of Tucker & Dale vs. Evil while references to Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street also abound.
            <br>
            <img src="../images/scare-package-3.jpg" alt="">
            Second, we have “One Time in the Woods” from Chris McInroy (Hellarious), an astoundingly goopy riff on the
            typical “camping in the woods” horror movie setup. Without spoiling the conceit, the gore effects are as
            howlingly funny as they are completely revolting, making this mere seven-minute short a spectacular splatter
            orgy complete with outrageous one-liners.
            <br>
            Next, Rian Johnson’s old pal Noah Segan co-writes, directs, and stars in “M.I.S.T.E.R,” which begins as a
            pointed parody of Fight Club before suddenly changing lanes into a satirical take on a certain classic
            horror subgenre. Segan riffs sardonically on the toils of toxic masculinity through a simple but effective
            metaphor, even if the late-stage action is a tad rough, and the elliptical ending is a bit of a shoulder
            shrug. It’s neat to see him venturing out into pastures like this though, for sure.
            <br>
            <img src="../images/scare-package-2.jpg" alt="">
            Fourth is “Girls’ Night Out of Body” from duo Courtney and Hillary Andujar, self-labelled as a “post-modern
            feminist slasher revenge body-horror” film, focused on four young women who find themselves preyed upon by a
            Michael Myers-esque stalker, only to turn the tables on him in a uniquely demented way. This thing is
            gorgeously neon-soaked – it’s little surprise the Andujars are Hollywood production designers – with some
            imaginative practical effects, yet while it inverts slasher tropes in a cute way, it’s really more style
            than substance.
            <br>
            Short number five is “The Night He Came Back Again! Part IV: The Final Kill” from Anthony Cousins, which
            nobody will be surprised to learn is a thinly-veiled parody of the Friday the 13th franchise. Cousins
            rattles through the Jason tropes with a relentless efficiency, and though the digital effects here are
            absolutely wretched, the focus is thankfully placed more on practical gore and some knowing performances
            from the cast. Best of all, it ends with a genuinely laugh-out-loud final twist.
            <br>
            Sixth, we have “So Much to Do” from Baron Vaughn (Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return), which collides
            The Fog with Get Out in a mildly amusing indictment of spoilerphobia. It’s a little messy ideas-wise, but
            the entertaining lead performance from Toni Trucks truly carries it past the finish line.
            <br>
            <img src="../images/scare-package-1.jpg" alt="">
            The less said about the final short, “Horror Hypothesis,” the better, given that even stating most of the
            films it invokes is probably too much of a spoiler. That said, there’s a sure Cabin in the Woods-esque vibe
            to this closing segment from Aaron B. Koontz – who also directed the wraparound – which is by far the
            longest and most narrative-driven of all seven stories. It’s perhaps a touch too long at almost 30 minutes,
            but makes the effort to dig deeper into its likeable cast of characters, and there’s a killer recurring Game
            of Thrones gag.
            <br>
            All in all, Scare Package rums the gamut from mediocre to very good, with no stories that quite gravitate
            either to greatness or awfulness. To that end, it’s easy to see how this anthology would be perfect
            screening material for the five-beers-deep midnight movie crowd.
            <br>
            It’s certainly witty in fits, and there are heaps of Easter eggs for eagle-eyed genre fans to salivate over,
            even if it lacks the conceptual cleverness to be a truly great example of the horror anthology. But with the
            shorts barely clocking in at 10 minutes a-piece, they largely end before they can even begin to invite
            ennui, and ultimately the sum of these parts proves more entertaining than any individual volume.
            <br>
            On the production side it’s acceptable enough, especially with regard to the delicious gore effects, though
            most of the shorts have that garish, over-lit sitcom quality to them which isn’t particularly pleasant to
            look at. On the aural side, however, Alex Cuervo’s synth-laden musical score accentuates the ’80s vibe
            terrifically well.
            <br>
            Though as inconsistent as any horror anthology, Scare Package impresses with its lashings of (mostly
            practical) gore and giddily off-the-wall sense of humour.
